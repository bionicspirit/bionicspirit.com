  This is the path I'm taking to <i>not suck</i> at design anymore, as
  frankly, I'm getting tired of sucking. I've read the first 3 books
  here and I'm having progress on the last one. I highly recommend all
  4.

<h2>The Design of Everyday Things (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465067107/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=alexanedel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0465067107" rel="nofollow" title="The Design of Everyday Things">link</a>)</h2>

</a>

<p>
  It explains the design of common household objects that you may use
  daily and it is one of the best books you can read on user
  experience.
</p>

<p>
  To me this was an eye opener that completely changed the way I think
  about interfaces. It explains how people interact with the objects
  around them and how they learn. It explains the importance of a
  user's mental model of how your product works. It gives you a good
  feeling on what it means and why it matters to <i>design for
  errors</i>. It helps you to prevent a lot of design errors that a
  lot of products have.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
  The book itself was written in 1990, so it does have here and there
  some references to products that are outdated, but the analysis
  itself will never be outdated or obsolete. Quite the contrary - it's
  fascinating how user centric design guidlines <i>stay the same</i>,
  even though there are a lot of people out there that repeat the same
  mistakes over and over again.
</p>

<p>
  When it comes to software, a complement article on the subject is <a
  href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/fog0000000249.html">User
  Interface Design For Programmers</a>, by Joel Spolsky.

<h2>Non-Designer's Design Book (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321534042/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&tag=alexanedel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0321534042" rel="nofollow" title="Non-Designer's Design Book">link</a>)</h2>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321534042/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&tag=alexanedel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0321534042" title="Non-Designer's Design Book" rel="nofollow">

</a>

<p>
  Robin Williams does an excelent job introducing you to the basic
  concepts of designing visuals, with clearly explained principles and
  techniques.
</p>

<p>
  It's pretty hard for us developers to design anything pleasing to
  the eye. And that's not the only problem you're facing - the visuals
  of a site have to give hints to the user about their next actions,
  so you've got many constraints to worry about. Sometimes you get
  lucky by just copying and combining other designs you
  like. Sometimes you have a good idea about what you want, but one
  day you like the result, then the next it looks like an abomination.
</p>

<p>
  The book goes into some detail about how designers think. It has
  plenty of visual examples, it gives you many examples of what <i>not
  to do</i>, it explains how to work around those problems, it is
  concise and doesn't bore you to tears - while not that useful for
  someone with design experience, for a developer that sucks at this
  game, this is a really, really good design manual.

<h2>Color: A Course in Mastering the Art of Mixing Colors (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585422193/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&tag=alexanedel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=1585422193" rel="nofollow" title="Color: A Course in Mastering the Art of Mixing Colors">link</a>)</h2>

</a>

<p>
  One of the most surprisingly difficult problems when creating
  designs is picking the colors palette. This is so goddamn difficult
  sometimes. We do know that certain color combinations work better
  than others, but how do you pick them? How can you achieve
  <i>harmony</i> as to not make your users' eyes bleed?

  And not only that, but you also want to emphasise certain portions
  of your pages in a way to attract attention - did you know that
  according to statistics, <i>more car accidents involve red cars than
  any other color?</i>
</p>

<p>
  There are web services out there, like <a
  href="http://kuler.adobe.com/">Adobe Kuler</a> or <a
  href="http://www.colourlovers.com/">COLOURlovers.com</a> which allow you to choose color
  palettes created by other people - the PROBLEM being that you'll
  never know what makes a palette work and so you'll make good changes
  to it only by luck or with expensive A/B testing.
</p>

<p>
  This book by Betty Edwards is not your only choice for learning
  Color Theory. It isn't even related to web design in any way, having
  a whole section on mixing oil paint. 
</p>

<p>
  However, I believe that color theory can only be learned from people
  that have real experience in mixing colors. For this reason,
  articles or books about color theory that aren't written by painters
  are quite shallow - and the theory in this book transcends the tools
  used.
</p>

<p>
  It explains notions on color harmony, on the importance of contrast
  and gives you valuable insight and advices on how to mix and match
  colors. It's a fun read too, because of the quotes from faimous
  people contained - however, it's not a light read because you do
  have to execute the exercises within for best results. But I think
  it is worth it.
</p>

<p>
  (I'm now my wife's advisor on colors, although our bedroom ended up
  looking awful, but there's no substitute for experience earned by
  making mistakes and at least I know where I went wrong ;))

<h2>Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0874774195/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&tag=alexanedel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0874774195"  rel="nofollow" title="The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain">link</a>)</h2>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0874774195/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&tag=alexanedel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0874774195" rel="nofollow" title="The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain">
  <img src="/assets/img/book-design-4.jpg" class="right" width="131" height="160" alt="Book design 4" />
</a>

<p>
  I've picked up drawing as my hobby. I'm only a beginner, but it's
  a fun hobby to have - it's impressive, silent and inexpensive. It also
  boosts your creativity like nothing else, as the only real limit you
  have is your imagination (much like software development ;))
</p>

<p>
  Ever tried drawing anything lately? You should. The results will be
  awful. But do you know why? It's not your hand, it's not from a lack
  of talent, it's your eyes that are deceiving you - <i>in order to
  learn how to draw, you have to relearn how to see</i>. That's
  because everything you see is right now filtered and transformed by
  your brain - as a cheap/fast exercise, look in a mirror at an arm's
  length and take a guess if your mirrored head is of the same size as
  your actual head (then use your hands to measure). The picture
  you're getting through your mind's eye is deceiving and for drawing
  skill and creativity to emerge you have to silence your brain.
</p>

<p>
  This book of Betty Edwards has an awesome technique that works for
  everybody. Or so she says, but as far as I'm concerned I'm
  progressing in leaps and bounds and can already do drawings that I
  couldn't hope of doing before starting to read this book ... I also
  promise to publish some drawings, but only after I'll get decent
  (only started to do this 2 months ago, a frog doesn't transform into
  a prince overnight you know).
</p>

<p>
  How does drawing help you in web design? Well, do you really have to
  ask?
</p>
